In recent years, the rapid urbanization and population growth in Dhaka, the capital city

of Bangladesh, have led to increased demand for efficient and sustainable transporta-
tion solutions. The introduction of the Dhaka Metro Rail system is a significant step

towards addressing these challenges. As the city strives to modernize its public trans-
portation infrastructure, the implementation of an online ticket service system for the

Dhaka Metro Rail marks a crucial advancement. This capstone project aims to intro-
duce the first-ever online ticket service dedicated to facilitating seamless and convenient

access to metro rail services in Dhaka. The literature in the realm of urban transporta-
tion underscores the importance of integrating technology to enhance the efficiency

and accessibility of public transit systems. Traditional ticketing methods often result
in long queues and time-consuming processes, discouraging potential commuters from
utilizing metro services. Research has consistently identified the need for innovative

solutions that streamline ticketing processes, reduce congestion, and improve the over-
all user experience. The introduction of online ticketing systems has proven successful

in various metropolitan areas globally, contributing to increased ridership and customer
satisfaction.
